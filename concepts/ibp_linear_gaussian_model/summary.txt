The linear-Gaussian IBP model is a simple matrix factorization model, where the model assumes the observed data results from linearly combining a subset of K independent real-valued latent factors: X = Z x A + E, where X is the N x D observed data matrix, Z is the N x K binary latent feature matrix, A is the K x D latent real-valued factor matrix, and E is N x D matrix of iid noise. Using an IBP prior allows the number of latent features, K, to be learned from the data. This model is commonly used for developing new IBP inference techniques.
