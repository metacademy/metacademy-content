Annealed importance sampling (AIS) is a Monte Carlo algorithm based on sampling from a sequence of distributions which interpolate between a tractable initial distribution and the intractable target distribution. It returns a set of weighted samples, and in the limit of infinitely many intermediate distributions, the variance of the weights approahces zero. The most common use is in estimating partition functions.
